If you want to launch the website (Landing Page) on a new server using xampp, you can try and copy the xampp folder and put it directly in the C folder.
Else if you want to set it up on your own you can find in the "LP.rar" and if to attach the SSL certificate you can find it in the 
"CropVision SSL Certificate.rar"
